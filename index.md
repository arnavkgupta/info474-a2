The top two visualizations represent the total number of US births each month in both 2013 and 2014. The purpose of these visualizations is to show the difference in birth rate for both of the years. Not only does it show a yearly change but it also displays the monthly change during each year. It is crucial to monitor birth rates as they rise and fall and measure these trends to track important changes and what they may mean for our society's future. The first graph highlights the total number of births per month in 2013, as shown by the blue line. The second graph highlights the total number of births per month in 2014. The birth rates for both years seem to be relatively the same with minor differences in between months. 

The next two visualizations in the second row represent the total number of US deaths each month in both 2013 and 2014. The left-most graph displays the deaths per month in the year of 2013. The right-most graph displays the number of deaths per month in 2014. The death rate seems to be relatively the same between both years until the fall/winter time where we see dramatic spikes in both 2013 and 2014. While it is important to measure birth rates, it is as important to measure death rates as well. Tracking population changes as a whole is crucial to analyze for societal measures. 

The last two visualizations in the third row combine both birth and death rates and compares them for 2013 and 2014 individually. This was necessary to see whether the rate of births is higher than the rate of deaths or vice versa. This will allow us to assess the growth of the US population, health inequalities, and population mortality rates. In the left-most graph, the birth rate, represented by blue, seems to be higher than the death rate for most of the year, 2013, except for the months of January and February. In the right-most graph, the birth rate is higher than the death rate in 2014 during the middle of the year. However, in the beginning and end of the year, there was less of a difference between the birth rate and death rate. Overall, through these visualizations, we can see that the population growth is positive for the most part which could bode well for society.
